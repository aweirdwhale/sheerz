## Sheerz, to keep shepherds awake.

**Sheerz** is a mobile application for shepherds. Its primary aim is to make it easier to count sheep in summer pastures. Simply take a photo of the flock with the app, and an artificial intelligence based on the yolov5 (you only look once) model counts for you. It's a good idea to check the count, though, so the app shows you which sheep have been counted, allowing you to check that no sheep are missing, or that other animals such as a hairy patou are not being counted.
